description: 'Detects usage of the "cipher" built-in utility in order to overwrite
    deleted data from disk.

    Adversaries may destroy data and files on specific systems or in large numbers
    on a network to interrupt availability to systems, services, and network resources.

    Data destruction is likely to render stored data irrecoverable by forensic techniques
    through overwriting files or data on local and remote drives
