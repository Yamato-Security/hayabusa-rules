    Detects the creation of a child "explorer.exe" process from a shell like process such as "cmd.exe" or "powershell.exe".
    Attackers can use "explorer.exe" for evading defense mechanisms by proxying the execution through the latter.
    While this is often a legitimate action, this rule can be use to hunt for anomalies.
    Muddy Waters threat actor was seeing using this technique.
