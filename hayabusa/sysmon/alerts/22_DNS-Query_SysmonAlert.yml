         #The Status field gives by status codes like 0, 123, and 1460. 0 seems to mean success but I am not sure what 123 and 1460 mean so we will omit this for now.

    This event is generated when a process executes a DNS query, whether the result is successful or fails, cached or not. 
    The telemetry for this event was added for Windows 8.1 so it is not available on Windows 7 and earlier.
