    Detects installation of NalDrv or PROCEXP152 services via registry-keys to non-system32 folders.
    Both services are used in the tool Ghost-In-The-Logs (https://github.com/bats3c/Ghost-In-The-Logs), which uses KDU (https://github.com/hfiref0x/KDU)
detection:
    SELECTION_1:
        EventID: 13
    SELECTION_2:
        Channel: Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational
    SELECTION_3:
        EventType: SetValue
    SELECTION_4:
        TargetObject:
        - HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\NalDrv\ImagePath
        - HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\PROCEXP152\ImagePath
    SELECTION_5:
        Image:
        - '*\procexp64.exe'
        - '*\procexp.exe'
        - '*\procmon64.exe'
        - '*\procmon.exe'
        - '*\handle.exe'
        - '*\handle64.exe'
    SELECTION_6:
        Details: '*\WINDOWS\system32\Drivers\PROCEXP152.SYS*'
    condition: ((SELECTION_1 and SELECTION_2) and (SELECTION_3 and SELECTION_4) and  not
        (SELECTION_5 and SELECTION_6))
falsepositives:
- Other legimate tools using this service names and drivers. Note - clever attackers
    may easily bypass this detection by just renaming the services. Therefore just
    Medium-level and don't rely on it.
