title: Suspicious Driver Loaded By User

description: Detects the loading of drivers via 'SeLoadDriverPrivilege' required to
  load or unload a device driver. With this privilege, the user can dynamically load
  and unload device drivers or other code in to kernel mode. This user right does
  not apply to Plug and Play device drivers. If you exclude privileged users/admins
  and processes, which are allowed to do so, you are maybe left with bad programs
  trying to load malicious kernel drivers. This will detect Ghost-In-The-Logs (https://github.com/bats3c/Ghost-In-The-Logs)
  and the usage of Sysinternals and various other tools. So you have to work with
  a whitelist to find the bad stuff.

falsepositives:
- 'Other legimate tools loading drivers. There are some: Sysinternals, CPU-Z, AVs
  etc. - but not much. You have to baseline this according to your used products and
  allowed tools. Also try to exclude users, which are allowed to load drivers.'
