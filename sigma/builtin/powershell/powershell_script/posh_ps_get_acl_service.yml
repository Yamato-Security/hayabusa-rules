description: 'Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the
    Registry entries used by services.

    originally specified executable to one that they control, in order to launch their
    own code at Service start.

    Windows stores local service configuration information in the Registry under HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
