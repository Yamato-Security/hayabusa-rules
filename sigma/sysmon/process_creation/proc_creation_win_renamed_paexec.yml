falsepositives:
    - Weird admins that rename their tools
    - Software companies that bundle PAExec with their software and rename it, so that it is less embarrassing
    - When executed with the "-s" flag. PAExec will copy itself to the "C:\Windows\" directory with a different name. Usually like this "PAExec-[XXXXX]-[ComputerName]"
