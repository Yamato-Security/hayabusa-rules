title: CobaltStrike Service Installations in Registry
ruletype: Sigma
author: Wojciech Lesicki
date: 2021/06/29
description: Detects known malicious service installs that appear in cases in which
  a Cobalt Strike beacon elevates privileges or lateral movement. We can also catch
  this by system log 7045 (https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/master/rules/windows/builtin/win_cobaltstrike_service_installs.yml)
  In some SIEM you can catch those events also in HKLM\System\ControlSet001\Services
  or HKLM\System\ControlSet002\Services, however, this rule is based on a regular
  sysmon's events.

  SELECTION_1:
    EventID: 4657
