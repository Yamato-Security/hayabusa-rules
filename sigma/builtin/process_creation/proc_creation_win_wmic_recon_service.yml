title: Service Reconnaissance Via Wmic.EXE
id: 145ace9e-159a-7105-5f01-b8880c351067
status: test
description: |
    An adversary might use WMI to check if a certain remote service is running on a remote device.
    When the test completes, a service information will be displayed on the screen if it exists.
    A common feedback message is that "No instance(s) Available" if the service queried is not running.
    A common error message is "Node - (provided IP or default) ERROR Description =The RPC server is unavailable" if the provided remote host is unreachable
