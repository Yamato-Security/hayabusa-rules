title: User Added To Local Administrators Group
details: 'SID: %MemberSid% | Group: %TargetUserName% | LID: %SubjectLogonId%'
description: A user was added to the local Administrators group. Unfortunately the user name does not get recorded in the log, only the SID, so you need to look up the username via the SID.
