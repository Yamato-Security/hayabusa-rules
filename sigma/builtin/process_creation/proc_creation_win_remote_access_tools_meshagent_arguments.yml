description: |
    Detects potential execution of MeshAgent which is a tool used for remote access.
    Historical data shows that threat actors rename MeshAgent binary to evade detection.
    Matching command lines with the '--meshServiceName' argument can indicate that the MeshAgent is being used for remote access.
