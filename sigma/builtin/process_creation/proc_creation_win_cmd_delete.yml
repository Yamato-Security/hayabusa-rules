description: 'Adversaries may delete files left behind by the actions of their intrusion
    activity.

    Malware, tools, or other non-native files dropped or created on a system by an
    adversary may leave traces to indicate to what was done within a network and how.

    Removal of these files can occur during an intrusion, or as part of a post-intrusion
    process to minimize the adversary''s footprint.
