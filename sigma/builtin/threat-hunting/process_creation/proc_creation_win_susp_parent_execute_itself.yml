    Detects when an executable launches an identical instance of itself, a behavior often used to create a suspended “sacrificial” process for code injection or evasion.
    Investigate for indicators such as the process being started in suspended mode, rapid parent termination, memory manipulation (e.g., WriteProcessMemory, CreateRemoteThread), or unsigned binaries.
    Review command-line arguments, process ancestry, and network activity to confirm if this is legitimate behavior or process injection activity.
