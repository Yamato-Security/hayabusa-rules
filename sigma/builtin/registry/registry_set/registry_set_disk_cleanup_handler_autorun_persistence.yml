description: "Detects when an attacker modifies values of the Disk Cleanup Handler\
    \ in the registry to achieve persistence via autorun.\nThe disk cleanup manager\
    \ is part of the operating system.\nIt displays the dialog box [\u2026] The user\
    \ has the option of enabling or disabling individual handlers by selecting or\
    \ clearing their check box in the disk cleanup manager's UI.\nAlthough Windows\
    \ comes with a number of disk cleanup handlers, they aren't designed to handle\
    \ files produced by other applications.\nInstead, the disk cleanup manager is\
    \ designed to be flexible and extensible by enabling any developer to implement\
    \ and register their own disk cleanup handler.\nAny developer can extend the available\
    \ disk cleanup services by implementing and registering a disk cleanup handler.\n"
