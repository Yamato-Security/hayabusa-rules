title: Potential System Information Discovery Via Wmic.EXE
id: 9d5a1274-922a-49d0-87f3-8c653483b909
status: experimental
description: 'Detects the use of the WMI command-line (WMIC) utility to identify and
    display various system information,

    including OS, CPU, GPU, and disk drive names; memory capacity; display resolution;
    and baseboard, BIOS,

    and GPU driver products/versions.

    Some of these commands were used by Aurora Stealer in late 2022/early 2023.
