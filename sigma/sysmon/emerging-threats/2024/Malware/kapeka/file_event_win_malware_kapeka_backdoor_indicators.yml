    Detects the presence of a file that is decrypted backdoor binary dropped by the Kapeka Dropper, which disguises itself as a hidden file under a folder named "Microsoft" within "CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA" or "CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA", depending on the process privileges.
    The file, typically 5-6 characters long with a random combination of consonants and vowels followed by a ".wll" extension to pose as a legitimate file to evade detection.
