status: test
description: 'HxTsr.exe is a Microsoft compressed executable file called Microsoft
    Outlook Communications.

    HxTsr.exe is part of Outlook apps, because it resides in a hidden "WindowsApps"
    subfolder of "C:\Program Files".

    Its path includes a version number, e.g., "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps_17.7466.41167.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\HxTsr.exe".

    Any instances of hxtsr.exe not in this folder may be malware camouflaging itself
    as HxTsr.exe
