title: 'RDP Conn (Noisy)'
details: ''
description: |
    This event is generated when anyone connects to RDP and sends data. It does not need to be a legitimate RDP connection.
    Unfortunately, there are no details about the remote machine.
    This event is noisy and will generate a lot of logs and is of limited investigative value.
    If you see a large number of these events, but not successful logon events with EID 1149, etc... then it may indicate a brute force attack.
    The Security event log will have more information so this event is only useful if the Security event logs are not available.
