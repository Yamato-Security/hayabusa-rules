    definition: Note that you have to configure logging for Named Pipe Events in Sysmon
        config (Event ID 17 and Event ID 18). The basic configuration is in popular
        sysmon configuration (https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config), but
        it is worth verifying. You can also use other repo, e.g. https://github.com/Neo23x0/sysmon-config,
        https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular. How to test detection? You
        can check powershell script from this site https://svch0st.medium.com/guide-to-named-pipes-and-hunting-for-cobalt-strike-pipes-dc46b2c5f575
