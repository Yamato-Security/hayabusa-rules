description: 'Adversaries may attempt to find local system groups and permission settings.

    The knowledge of local system permission groups can help adversaries determine
    which groups exist and which users belong to a particular group.

    Adversaries may use this information to determine which users have elevated permissions,
    such as the users found within the local administrators group.
