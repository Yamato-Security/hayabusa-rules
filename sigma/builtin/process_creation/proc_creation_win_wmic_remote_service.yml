    on a remote device.

    When the test completes, a service information will be displayed on the screen
    if it exists.

    A common feedback message is that "No instance(s) Available" if the service queried
    is not running.

    A common error message is "Node - (provided IP or default) ERROR Description =The
    RPC server is unavailable" if the provided remote host is unreachable
