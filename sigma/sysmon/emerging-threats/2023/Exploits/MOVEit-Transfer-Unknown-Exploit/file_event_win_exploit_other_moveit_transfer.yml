id: c3b2a774-3152-4989-83c1-7afc48fd1599
status: experimental
description: 'Detects the creation of files with unexpected extensions in the web
    root folder of the MOVEit Transfer service.

    Reports mentioned uncommon file types in the "wwwroot" folder as a sign of potential
    compromise. Attackers used that folder as a staging directory for the exfiltration.
