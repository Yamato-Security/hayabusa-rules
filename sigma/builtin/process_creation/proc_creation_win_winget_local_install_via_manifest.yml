id: 313d6012-51a0-4d93-8dfc-de8553239e25
status: experimental
description: 'Detects usage of winget to install applications via manifest file. Adversaries
    can abuse winget to download payloads remotely and execute them.

    The manifest option enables you to install an application by passing in a YAML
    file directly to the client.

    Winget can be used to download and install exe, msi or msix files later.
