falsepositives:
    - You may have to tune certain domains out that Excel may call out to, such as microsoft or other business use case domains.
    - Office documents commonly have templates that refer to external addresses, like "sharepoint.ourcompany.com" may have to be tuned.
    - It is highly recommended to baseline your activity and tune out common business use cases.
