description: "Detects when an attacker modifies values of the Disk Cleanup Handler\
    \ in the registry to achieve persistence.\nThe disk cleanup manager is part of\
    \ the operating system. It displays the dialog box [\u2026]\nThe user has the\
    \ option of enabling or disabling individual handlers by selecting or clearing\
    \ their check box in the disk cleanup manager's UI.\nAlthough Windows comes with\
    \ a number of disk cleanup handlers, they aren't designed to handle files produced\
    \ by other applications.\nInstead, the disk cleanup manager is designed to be\
    \ flexible and extensible by enabling any developer to implement and register\
    \ their own disk cleanup handler.\nAny developer can extend the available disk\
    \ cleanup services by implementing and registering a disk cleanup handler.\n"
