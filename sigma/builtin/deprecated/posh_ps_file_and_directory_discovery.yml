    Adversaries may enumerate files and directories or may search in specific locations of a host or network share for certain information within a file system.
    Adversaries may use the information from [File and Directory Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors,
    including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.
