title: Disabling Windows Event Auditing

status: test
description: 'Detects scenarios where system auditing (ie: windows event log auditing)
    is disabled.

    This may be used in a scenario where an entity would want to bypass local logging
    to evade detection when windows event logging is enabled and reviewed.

    Also, it is recommended to turn off "Local Group Policy Object Processing" via
    GPO, which will make sure that Active Directory GPOs take precedence over local/edited
    computer policies via something such as "gpedit.msc".

    Please note, that disabling "Local Group Policy Object Processing" may cause an
    issue in scenarios of one off specific GPO modifications -- however it is recommended
    to perform these modifications in Active Directory anyways.
