title: Suspicious Use of Procdump on LSASS
ruletype: Sigma

description: Detects suspicious uses of the SysInternals Procdump utility by using
    a special command line parameter in combination with the lsass.exe process. This
    way we're also able to catch cases in which the attacker has renamed the procdump
    executable.
detection:
    SELECTION_1:
        EventID: 1
    SELECTION_2:
        Channel: Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational
    SELECTION_3:
        CommandLine:
        - '* -ma *'
        - '* /ma *'
    SELECTION_4:
        CommandLine: '* ls*'
    condition: (SELECTION_1 and SELECTION_2 and SELECTION_3 and SELECTION_4)
falsepositives:
- Unlikely, because no one should dump an lsass process memory
- Another tool that uses the command line switches of Procdump
