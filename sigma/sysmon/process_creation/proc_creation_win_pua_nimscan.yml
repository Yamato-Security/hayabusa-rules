    Detects usage of NimScan, a portscanner utility.
    In early 2025, adversaries were observed using this utility to scan for open ports on remote hosts in a compromised environment.
    This rule identifies the execution of NimScan based on the process image name and specific hash values associated with different versions of the tool.
