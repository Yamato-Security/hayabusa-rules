title: NetWire RAT Registry Key
ruletype: Sigma
Note: You likely will have to change the sysmon configuration file. Per SwiftOnSecurity
  "Because Sysmon runs as a service, it has no filtering ability for, or concept of,
  HKCU or HKEY_CURRENT_USER. Use "contains" or "end with" to get around this limitation"
  Therefore I set <TargetObject condition="contains">netwire</TargetObjecct> in my
  configuration.
