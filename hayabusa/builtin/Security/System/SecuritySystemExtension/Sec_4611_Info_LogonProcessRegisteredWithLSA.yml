title: 'Logon Proc Registered With LSA'
description: 'A logon process has registered with the Local Security Authority (LSA). Logon requests will now be accepted from this source. Technically, the event does not come from the registration of a trusted logon process, but from a confirmation that the process is a trusted logon process. If it is a trusted logon process, the event generates. A logon process is a trusted part of the OS that handles logon methods (network, interactive, etc.)'
