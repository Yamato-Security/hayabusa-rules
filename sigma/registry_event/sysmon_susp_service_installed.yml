description: Detects installation of NalDrv or PROCEXP152 services via registry-keys
  to non-system32 folders. Both services are used in the tool Ghost-In-The-Logs (https://github.com/bats3c/Ghost-In-The-Logs),
  which uses KDU (https://github.com/hfiref0x/KDU)
detection:
  SELECTION_1:
    EventID: 12
  SELECTION_2:
    EventID: 13
  SELECTION_3:
    EventID: 14
  SELECTION_4:
    EventType: SetValue
  SELECTION_5:
    TargetObject:
    - HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\NalDrv\ImagePath
    - HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\PROCEXP152\ImagePath
  SELECTION_6:
    Image:
    - '*\procexp64.exe'
    - '*\procexp.exe'
    - '*\procmon64.exe'
    - '*\procmon.exe'
  SELECTION_7:
    Details:
    - '*\WINDOWS\system32\Drivers\PROCEXP152.SYS*'
  condition: ((SELECTION_1 or SELECTION_2 or SELECTION_3) and ((SELECTION_4 and SELECTION_5)
    and  not (SELECTION_6)) and  not (SELECTION_7))
falsepositives:
- Other legimate tools using this service names and drivers. Note - clever attackers
  may easily bypass this detection by just renaming the services. Therefore just Medium-level
  and don't rely on it.
