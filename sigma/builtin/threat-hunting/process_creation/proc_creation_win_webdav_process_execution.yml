description: |
    Detects execution of processes with image paths starting with WebDAV shares (\\), which might indicate malicious file execution from remote web shares.
    Execution of processes from WebDAV shares can be a sign of lateral movement or exploitation attempts, especially if the process is not a known legitimate application.
    Exploitation Attempt of vulnerabilities like CVE-2025-33053 also involves executing processes from WebDAV paths.
