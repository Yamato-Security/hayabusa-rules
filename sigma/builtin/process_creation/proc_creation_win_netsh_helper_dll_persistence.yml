title: Potential Persistence Via Netsh Helper DLL
id: 56321594-9087-49d9-bf10-524fe8479452
status: test
description: Detects the execution of netsh with "add helper" flag in order to add
    a custom helper DLL. This technique can be abused to add a malicious helper DLL
    that can be used as a persistence proxy that gets called when netsh.exe is executed.
