    Detects execution of TruffleHog, a tool used to search for secrets in different platforms like Git, Jira, Slack, SharePoint, etc. that could be used maliciously.
    While it is a legitimate tool, intended for use in CI pipelines and security assessments,
    It was observed in the Shai-Hulud malware campaign targeting npm packages to steal sensitive information.
