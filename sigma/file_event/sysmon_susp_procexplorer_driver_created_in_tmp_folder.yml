description: Detects the creation of the PROCEXP152.sys file in the application-data
  local temporary folder. This driver is used by Sysinternals Process Explorer but
  also by KDU (https://github.com/hfiref0x/KDU) or Ghost-In-The-Logs (https://github.com/bats3c/Ghost-In-The-Logs),
  which uses KDU.
detection:
  SELECTION_1:
    EventID: 11
  SELECTION_2:
    TargetFilename: '*\AppData\Local\Temp\\*'
  SELECTION_3:
    TargetFilename: '*PROCEXP152.sys'
  SELECTION_4:
    Image:
    - '*\procexp64.exe*'
    - '*\procexp.exe*'
    - '*\procmon64.exe*'
    - '*\procmon.exe*'
  condition: (SELECTION_1 and (SELECTION_2 and SELECTION_3) and  not (SELECTION_4))
falsepositives:
- Other legimate tools using this driver and filename (like Sysinternals). Note -
  Clever attackers may easily bypass this detection by just renaming the driver filename.
  Therefore just Medium-level and don't rely on it.
