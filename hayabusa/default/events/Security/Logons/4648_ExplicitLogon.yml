    This log is generated when
    1. A user connects to a server or runs a program locally using alternate credentials.  
       For instance a user maps a drive to a server but specifies a different user's credentials or opens a shortcut under RunAs by shift-control-right-clicking on the shortcut, 
       selecting Run as..., and then filling in a different user's credentials in the dialog box that appears.  Or a user logs on to a web site using new specific credentials. 
    2. When a process logs on as a different account such as when the Scheduled Tasks service starts a task as the specified user. 
    3. With User Account Control enabled, an end user runs a program requiring admin authority.  You will get this event where the process information is consent.exe.  
       Unfortunately the Subject does not identify the end user.
    4. Logging on interactively to a server with a domain account. (Two 4624 events will also be generated.)
