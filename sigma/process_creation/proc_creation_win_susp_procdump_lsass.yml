title: Suspicious Use of Procdump on LSASS
ruletype: Sigma

description: Detects suspicious uses of the SysInternals Procdump utility by using
  a special command line parameter in combination with the lsass.exe process. This
  way we're also able to catch cases in which the attacker has renamed the procdump
  executable.
detection:
  SELECTION_1:
    EventID: 1
  SELECTION_2:
    CommandLine: '* -ma *'
  SELECTION_3:
    CommandLine: '* lsass*'
  SELECTION_4:
    CommandLine: '* -ma *'
  SELECTION_5:
    CommandLine: '* ls*'
  condition: (SELECTION_1 and ((SELECTION_2 and SELECTION_3) or (SELECTION_4 and SELECTION_5)))
falsepositives:
- Unlikely, because no one should dump an lsass process memory
- Another tool that uses the command line switches of Procdump
