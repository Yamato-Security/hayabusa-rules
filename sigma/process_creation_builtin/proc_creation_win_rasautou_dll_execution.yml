  definition: Since options '-d' and '-p' were removed in Windows 10 this rule is
    relevant only for Windows before 10. And as Windows 7 doesn't log command line
    in 4688 by default, to detect this attack you need Sysmon 1 configured or KB3004375
    installed for command-line auditing (https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/3004375/microsoft-security-advisory-update-to-improve-windows-command-line-aud)
